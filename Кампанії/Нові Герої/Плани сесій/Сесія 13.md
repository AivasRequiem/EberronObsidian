**Дата:** 14 Терендора 998 РХ
Команда приходить до [[Велика Скеля|Великої Скелі]] та відправляється на зустріч з [[Дочки Сори Келл]]

#### **План сесії:**
- [[Тукс]] відправляється домовлятись про зустріч з дочками. Тим часом [[Ксаріон Макар]] може купити Gauntlets of Ogre Power за 500 золотих. 
- [[Тукс]] повернеться з запискою, яка вкаже на секретний вхід до [[Палати Відьом]]. Ідучи по абсолютно темним коридорам та тунелям скелі, команда попадає у ледве освітлену залу у якій видно як за величезним круглим столом сидять 3 фігури.
