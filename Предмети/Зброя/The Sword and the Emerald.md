_Weapon (any sword), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3) (requires attunement)_
This magic item actually consists of two separate but interlinked magical items: A sword, and an emerald. The sword is a magical [+1, +2, or +3 sword](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Weapon,_%2B1,_%2B2,_or_%2B3 "5e SRD:Weapon, +1, +2, or +3"). The emerald is a finely cut, deep bright green gem which can be used to control the wielder of the sword.
_**Curse.**_ This sword is cursed, and being attuned to it extends the curse to you. While you are cursed, the creature who is attuned to the emerald and holding the emerald can cast [_dominate monster_](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Dominate_Monster "5e SRD:Dominate Monster") (save DC 20) on you at will, without needing a spell slot or any components.
