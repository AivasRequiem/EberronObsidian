The Blade of Shadows, known as _Kage no Yaiba_, is a beautifully crafted katana with an intricately designed hilt wrapped in black silk. The blade itself is forged from a dark, almost obsidian-like metal that seems to absorb light. Subtle, dark runes are etched along the blade's length, pulsating with an eerie, faint glow.

**Properties:**
- **Type:** Katana (treated as a longsword)
- **Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)**

#### Initial Properties (Cursed)
- **Damage:** 1d8 slashing (versatile 1d10)
- **Magic Weapon:** The Blade of Shadows grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
- **Shadow Strike:** Once per short rest, you can invoke the power of shadows to deal an additional 1d8 necrotic damage on a hit. This damage increases to 2d8 if the target is in dim light or darkness.
- **Cursed:** This sword is cursed and possessed by a vengeful spirit. Becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the sword, keeping it on your person at all times. While attuned to this weapon, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.
- Immediately after you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, the haunting spirit grow too loud to ignore. Roll on the Kage no Yaiba table to determine the effect of these voices. Once one of these effects occurs, none of these haunting voices manifest again until you finish a short or long rest.

| 2   | You are deafened by the voices for 1 minute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 3   | You are frightened of the creature closest to you, other than yourself, until the end of your next turn. If multiple creatures are closest, the DM chooses which creature you are frightened of.                                                                                                                                           |
| 4   | Within the next 10 minutes, you can ask your spirits about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. You can receive an omen as if you had cast the [Augury](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:augury) spell. The omen manifests as whisperings from your spirits perceptible only to you. |
- The curse can only be removed by a _bannish_ spell or similar magic.

#### Unleashed Properties (Post-Curse Removal)
Once the curse is removed, the true power of Kage no Yaiba is revealed. Niho Koi’s spirit is banished from the blade, granting it additional abilities.
- **Damage:** 1d8 slashing (versatile 1d10)
- **Magic Weapon:** The Blade of Shadows grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
- **Shadow Strike:** Twice per short rest, you can invoke the power of shadows to deal an additional 1d8 necrotic damage on a hit. This damage increases to 2d8 if the target is in dim light or darkness.
- **Eclipsing Defense:** Once per long rest, as a reaction, you can call upon the blade’s power to envelop you in shadows, granting you temporary invisibility until the start of your next turn. This invisibility can be used to avoid an attack, reposition, or gain advantage on your next attack roll.
