**Description:** The Lute of the Witty Muse is an ancient and seemingly battered musical instrument, with a body made of dark, aged wood that has cracks and scratches from years of use and neglect. Its strings, though frayed and uneven, still resonate with a magical hum. Despite its worn appearance, the lute emanates a faint, warm glow, hinting at the arcane energy within.
**Appearance:**
- **Body:** The lute’s body is crafted from an exotic, dark wood with intricate carvings of musical notes and whimsical designs, though many of these are obscured by the wear and tear it has endured.
- **Strings:** The strings are a mix of old and new, with some appearing to be hastily replaced. They shimmer slightly when plucked, revealing their magical nature.
- **Tuning Pegs:** The pegs are adorned with tiny, engraved runes that glow faintly when the lute’s magic is activated.
**Personality:**
- **Consciousness:** The lute has a sentient consciousness, capable of telepathically communicating with its wielder. It possesses a snarky and witty personality, often offering sarcastic comments and unsolicited advice.
- **Communication:** It can communicate telepathically with its wielder within a range of 30 feet. Its voice is that of a smooth-talking bard with a hint of mischief.
**Abilities:**
- **+1 Bonus to Performance Checks:** The lute grants a +1 bonus to performance checks made while playing it, enhancing the bardic abilities of its wielder.
- **Cutting Words:** Once per day, the lute can use the _Cutting Words_ feature, allowing the wielder to subtract a 1d6 from an enemy’s attack roll, ability check, or damage roll as a reaction. The lute itself delivers the insult telepathically, often coming up with particularly biting and clever remarks that suit the situation.
- **Song of Rest:** The lute enhances the bard’s _Song of Rest_ feature. When the bard uses Song of Rest, allies regain an additional 1d6 hit points.
- **Mend Strings:** The lute can magically repair its own strings once per day, ensuring that it remains playable despite its aged condition.
**Flavor and Roleplay Elements:**
- **Snarky Advice:** The lute frequently offers commentary on the wielder’s actions and decisions, sometimes helpful, sometimes not. For example, if the wielder is about to engage in a risky action, the lute might say, "Are you sure that's a good idea? Last time you did something like this, it didn’t end well, remember?"
- **Historical Tidbits:** The lute occasionally shares stories of its previous owners and the adventures it has been on, providing historical lore and potential plot hooks for the party.
- **Personality Conflicts:** The lute’s snarky nature might occasionally clash with the wielder’s personality, leading to humorous and engaging roleplay scenarios.
**Backstory:**
- **Origin:** The lute was originally crafted by a legendary bard who infused it with a fragment of their own personality to ensure their legacy would live on. Over the centuries, it has passed through the hands of many musicians, each leaving their mark on it.
- **Current State:** Its current state of disrepair is due to a particularly reckless owner who used it in numerous battles and tavern brawls, ultimately leaving it abandoned in the Cog Hub.
