The Blight can't use the same effect two rounds in a row. The saving throw DC for these effects is 18.\n\n1. **Unmitigated Growth.** The Blight instigates unmitigated plant growth on its lair, turning the floor into difficult terrain until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n2. **Hardened Bark.** The soil’s nutrients surge into the Blight’s bark-like skin. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the Blight’s AC increases by 2.\n3. **Mist of the Memorial.** Dew condenses into a thick, silvery mist. The Blight chooses a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point it can see within 120 feet. The area is Heavily Obscured until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature of the Blight’s choice in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n4. **Prismatic Spores.** Mushrooms sprout and shake their caps in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the Blight can see within 120 feet, releasing multicolored spores. Each creature hostile to the Blight in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be afflicted with one random condition until initiative count 20 on the next round.

Until initiative count 20 on the next round, whenever a creature hostile to the Blight moves more than 5 feet on the ground in the lair, that creature takes 4 (1d8) Piercing damage for every 5 feet it moves.\n6. **Redirected Bloom.** The flowers of the lair absorb healing magic and redirect it toward the Blight. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, whenever a creature other than the Blight within 60 feet of it regains Hit Points from a spell or other magical effect, that creature regains only half as many Hit Points (round up), and the Blight regains the same number of Hit Points.\n7. **Beast Call.** The animals dwelling in the lair come to the Blight’s defense. The Blight summons up to four Beasts of challenge rating 1 or lower, which appear in unoccupied spaces at the edges of the lair. The summoned Beasts roll initiative as a group and act on their own turns. They remain until destroyed or until the Blight uses this lair action again.\n8. **Awakened Trees.** The plants of the lair twist and combine to form two Awakened Trees in unoccupied spaces the Blight can see. Each awakened tree rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. The trees remain until destroyed or until the Blight uses this lair action again.\n9. **Entangling Roots.** Roots rise from the soil of the lair, entangling the Blight’s enemies. Each creature hostile to the Blight that is on the ground in the lair must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained condition. A restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against the same DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n10. **Healing Lilies.** Two enormous lilies (Medium Plants) grow in two unoccupied spaces the Blight can see within 60 feet. Each lily has AC 5 and 15 Hit Points. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, at the start of each of the Blight’s turns, it regains 7 (2d6) Hit Points for each lily that remains. The lilies wither at initiative count 20 on the next round.\n11. **Damage Mushrooms.** Four enormous mushrooms (Medium Plants) grow in unoccupied spaces the Blight can see within 60 feet. Each mushroom has AC 15 and 10 Hit Points. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the Blight’s weapon attacks and spell attacks deal an extra 1 damage for each mushroom that remains (maximum +4). The mushrooms wither at initiative count 20 on the next round.\n12. **Antimagic Pollen.** The flowers of the lair shake, releasing a gray pollen that dulls all color and stifles foreign magic. The Blight chooses a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point it can see within 120 feet. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, that area functions as an antimagic zone for creatures hostile to the Blight: such creatures can't cast spells while in the area, and their ongoing spells and magical effects are suppressed there, as are the magical properties of items they wield or carry. The Blight’s own magic and that of its allies are unaffected.\n\nIf the Blight is destroyed and its Death Bloom phylactery is also destroyed, these effects end immediately. If only its body is destroyed, the lair effects persist as long as the Death Bloom remains intact."

The Blight can't use the same effect two rounds in a row. The saving throw DC for these effects is 18.\n\n1. **Unmitigated Growth.** The Blight instigates unmitigated plant growth on its lair, turning the floor into difficult terrain until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n2. **Hardened Bark.** The soil’s nutrients surge into the Blight’s bark-like skin. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the Blight’s AC increases by 2.\n3. **Mist of the Memorial.** Dew condenses into a thick, silvery mist. The Blight chooses a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point it can see within 120 feet. The area is Heavily Obscured until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature of the Blight’s choice in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n4. **Prismatic Spores.** Mushrooms sprout and shake their caps in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the Blight can see within 120 feet, releasing multicolored spores. Each creature hostile to the Blight in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be afflicted with one random condition until initiative count 20 on the next round.

Until initiative count 20 on the next round, whenever a creature hostile to the Blight moves more than 5 feet on the ground in the lair, that creature takes 4 (1d8) Piercing damage for every 5 feet it moves.\n6. **Redirected Bloom.** The flowers of the lair absorb healing magic and redirect it toward the Blight. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, whenever a creature other than the Blight within 60 feet of it regains Hit Points from a spell or other magical effect, that creature regains only half as many Hit Points (round up), and the Blight regains the same number of Hit Points.\n7. **Beast Call.** The animals dwelling in the lair come to the Blight’s defense. The Blight summons up to four Beasts of challenge rating 1 or lower, which appear in unoccupied spaces at the edges of the lair. The summoned Beasts roll initiative as a group and act on their own turns. They remain until destroyed or until the Blight uses this lair action again.\n8. **Awakened Trees.** The plants of the lair twist and combine to form two Awakened Trees in unoccupied spaces the Blight can see. Each awakened tree rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. The trees remain until destroyed or until the Blight uses this lair action again.\n\nIf the Blight is destroyed and its Death Bloom phylactery is also destroyed, these effects end immediately. If only its body is destroyed, the lair effects persist as long as the Death Bloom remains intact."
