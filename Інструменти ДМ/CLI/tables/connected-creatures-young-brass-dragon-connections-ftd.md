|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A [young brass dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-brass-dragon-xmm.md) and a [young blue dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-blue-dragon-xmm.md) fight over territory. |
| 2 | A [young brass dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-brass-dragon-xmm.md) frequently visits a [couatl](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/celestial/couatl-xmm.md) who is charged with guarding an ancient temple, sharing stories to help the couatl pass the years. |
| 3 | A [lamia](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/fiend/lamia-xmm.md) and a [young brass dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-brass-dragon-xmm.md) lair in the same desert ruin, mostly leaving each other alone—but the lamia hopes to corrupt the dragon. |
| 4 | A [young brass dragon's](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-brass-dragon-xmm.md) lair occasionally spawns [air elementals](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental-xmm.md) that roam around the area for a while, causing havoc before eventually dissipating. |
| 5 | A [young brass dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-brass-dragon-xmm.md) and a [weretiger](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/weretiger-xmm.md) have become close friends as they try to keep a region safe from a growing horde of malicious gnolls. |
| 6 | A [young brass dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-brass-dragon-xmm.md) allowed a group of [cyclopes](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/giant/cyclops-sentry-xmm.md) to shelter in the dragon's lair when they were harassed by a blue dragon. Now the cyclopes won't leave, so the dragon is trying to educate them. |
