| 2 | An [ancient gold dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-gold-dragon-xmm.md) is infatuated with an oblivious [empyrean](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/miscellaneous/empyrean-xmm.md), drawn in by the empyrean's carefree nature and larger-than-life emotions. |
| 3 | An [ancient gold dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-gold-dragon-xmm.md) and a [lich](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/undead/lich-xmm.md) have vied to bend history to their respective wills. The two have reluctantly come to understand and empathize with each other. |
| 4 | An [ancient gold dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-gold-dragon-xmm.md) takes little interest in the day-to-day governance of a powerful empire. But the dragon expects to be obeyed completely when deigning to address the populace. |
