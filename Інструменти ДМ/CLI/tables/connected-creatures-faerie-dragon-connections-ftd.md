**Faerie Dragon Connections**

| dice: d10 | Connected Creatures |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | An entrepreneurial gnome uses a [faerie dragon's](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-adult-xmm.md) Euphoria Breath to open a novel relaxation spa; the dragon appreciates the steady stream of treats and baubles they receive in exchange for their labor. |
| 2 | A [faerie dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-adult-xmm.md) is in love with a member of a [pixie](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/fey/pixie-xmm.md) royal court and is constantly searching for some grand deed capable of impressing their beloved. |
| 3 | A [faerie dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-adult-xmm.md) uses magic to aid in the rambling revels of a band of [satyrs](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/fey/satyr-xmm.md). |
| 4 | A [faerie dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-adult-xmm.md) and a [quasit](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/fiend/quasit-xmm.md) are sworn enemies, and their invisible battles and the elaborate traps they lay for each other cause havoc in the area where they both live. |
| 5 | A mercenary band keeps a [faerie dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-adult-xmm.md) captive in a cage, forcing the dragon to act as a jester. |
| 6 | A [faerie dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-adult-xmm.md) nests in the branches of a tree that recently received the benefit of a [druid's](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/druid-xmm.md) [awaken](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/spells/awaken-xphb.md) spell and promises to teach the [awakened tree](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/plant/awakened-tree-xmm.md) in exchange for shelter and companionship. |
| 7 | A [faerie dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-adult-xmm.md) rules a pack of [blink dogs](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/fey/blink-dog-xmm.md), leading them on a grand quest against evil that the dragon is making up along the way. |
| 8 | A [green dragon wyrmling](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/green-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md) has recruited a [faerie dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-adult-xmm.md) as a spy, though the faerie dragon's bizarre means of carrying out orders leaves the green dragon wondering if it's worth the effort. |
| 9 | A [faerie dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-adult-xmm.md) constantly tries to impress a gruff dwarf priest by proselytizing to everyone they meet as they travel together, but the dragon's interpretation of their "shared faith" is extremely eccentric. |
| 10 | A [faerie dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-adult-xmm.md) has intimidated a gang of [goblins](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/fey/goblin-warrior-xmm.md) and now forces the goblins to follow an increasingly bizarre set of rules. |
