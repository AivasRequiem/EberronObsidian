**Bronze Dragon Wyrmling Connections**

| dice: d6 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A flight of [pseudodragons](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/pseudodragon-xmm.md) has raised an orphaned [bronze dragon wyrmling](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/bronze-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md), who is quickly growing too large for the group's usual activities. |
| 2 | A [knight](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/knight-xmm.md) rescued a [bronze dragon wyrmling](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/bronze-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md) from sacrifice at the hands of a cult, and the two now travel together in search of wrongs to right. |
| 3 | A [bronze dragon wyrmling's](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/bronze-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md) murdered tutor rose as a [revenant](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/undead/revenant-xmm.md), and the dragon seeks anyone who can help obtain justice. |
| 4 | A [bronze dragon wyrmling](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/bronze-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md) has chosen a lair filled with [poisonous snakes](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/beast/venomous-snake-xmm.md), admiring the elegance with which they slither through the flooded tunnels. |
| 5 | A [bronze dragon wyrmling](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/bronze-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md) has been captured by [sahuagin](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/fiend/sahuagin-warrior-xmm.md) raiders and manipulated into serving as the band's icon and war leader. |
| 6 | A group of [merrow](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/merrow-xmm.md) stole a [bronze dragon wyrmling's](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/bronze-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md) hoard, and the wyrmling is training a [plesiosaurus](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/beast/plesiosaurus-xmm.md) to help attack the merrow's stronghold. |
