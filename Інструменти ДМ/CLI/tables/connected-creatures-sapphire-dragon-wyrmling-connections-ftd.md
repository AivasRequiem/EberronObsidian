|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | After being robbed by gnomes who had pledged to protect the hoard, a [sapphire dragon wyrmling](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/sapphire-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) installs new guardians that have no interest in material riches: [gelatinous cubes](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/ooze/gelatinous-cube-xmm.md) and [ochre jellies](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/ooze/ochre-jelly-xmm.md). |
| 2 | A band of [minotaurs](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur-of-baphomet-xmm.md) in service to Baphomet has captured a [sapphire dragon wyrmling](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/sapphire-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) to learn from the wyrmling's strategies. |
| 3 | Two [sapphire dragon wyrmlings](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/sapphire-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) vie for the same territory. Their primary battle tactic involves luring [grells](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/aberration/grell-xmm.md) into each other's lairs. |
| 4 | A group of Lolth-worshiping [drow warriors](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator-xmm.md) were sent to kill a [sapphire dragon wyrmling](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/sapphire-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) who has been making meals of their goddess's holy spiders. |
| 5 | A [sapphire dragon wyrmling](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/sapphire-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) is on the verge of starvation after incorrectly identifying a nearby [phase spider](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/phase-spider-xmm.md) nest as an easy food source. |
| 6 | A [sapphire dragon wyrmling's](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/sapphire-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) hoard contains a cursed item, which has attracted [specters](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/undead/specter-xmm.md) and [wraiths](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/undead/wraith-xmm.md) to the area around the dragon's lair. |
