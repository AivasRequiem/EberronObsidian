| 7 | A bullywug community seeks help to defeat an [adult black dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-black-dragon-xmm.md) who has been feasting on the bullywugs' domesticated [giant frogs](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-frog-xmm.md). |
| 8 | Two nations—one led by an [adult black dragon](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-black-dragon-xmm.md) and the other by a [yuan-ti abomination](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/yuan-ti-abomination-xmm.md)—are on the brink of joining forces to destroy a third nation. The threatened nation is recruiting adventurers to defend it. |
