# Rime's Binding Ice
*2nd-level, Evocation*  
![Rime's binding ice adds in...](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/spells/img/rimes-binding-ice.webp#right "Rime's binding ice adds insult to injury in the hands of a spellcasting white dragon.")

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Cone)
- **Components:** S, M (a vial of meltwater)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A burst of cold energy emanates from you in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `3d8` cold damage and is hindered by ice formations for 1 minute, or until it or another creature within reach of it uses an action to break away the ice. A creature hindered by ice has its speed reduced to 0. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't hindered by ice.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the cold damage by `d8` for each slot level above 2nd.
