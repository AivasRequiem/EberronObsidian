# Fizban's Platinum Shield
*6th-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a platinum-plated dragon scale, worth at least 500 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a field of silvery light that surrounds a creature of your choice within range (you can choose yourself). The field sheds dim light out to 5 feet. While surrounded by the field, a creature gains the following benefits:

- **Cover.** The creature has half cover.  
- **Damage Resistance.** The creature has resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and poison damage.  
- **Evasion.** If the creature is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the creature instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.  

As a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the field to another creature within 60 feet of the field.
