# Command
*1st-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. Choose the command from these options:

- **Approach.** The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.  
- **Drop.** The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.  
- **Flee.** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.  
- **Grovel.** The target has the [Prone](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition and then ends its turn.  
- **Halt.** On its turn, the target doesn't move and takes no action or [Bonus Action](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md).  

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can affect one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.
