# Maximilian's Earthen Grasp
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature hand sculpted from clay)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes `2d6` bludgeoning damage and is [restrained](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) for the spell's duration.

As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the [restrained](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) target, which must make a Strength saving throw. The target takes `2d6` bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

To break out, the [restrained](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer [restrained](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the hand.

As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a [restrained](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) target if you do either.
