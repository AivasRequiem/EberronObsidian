# Evard's Black Tentacles
*4th-level, Conjuration*  
![](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/spells/img/evards-black-tentacles.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tentacle)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in that area into [Difficult Terrain](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md).

Each creature in that area makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `3d6` Bludgeoning damage, and it has the [Restrained](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition until the spell ends. A creature also makes that save if it enters the area or ends it turn there. A creature makes that save only once per turn.

A [Restrained](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) creature can take an action to make a Strength ([Athletics](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check against your spell save DC, ending the condition on itself on a success.

**Classes**: [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Wizard](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Sorcerer (Aberrant Sorcery)](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-aberrant-sorcery-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
