# Draconic Transformation
*7th-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a statuette of a dragon, worth at least 500 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

With a roar, you draw on the magic of dragons to transform yourself, taking on draconic features. You gain the following benefits until the spell ends:

- **Blindsight.** You have [blindsight](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/senses.md#Blindsight) with a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're [blinded](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an [invisible](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creature, unless the creature successfully hides from you.  
- **Breath Weapon.** When you cast this spell, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns for the duration, you can exhale shimmering energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:6d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d8`) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
- **Wings.** Incorporeal wings sprout from your back, giving you a flying speed of 60 feet.  

**Classes**: [Bard](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Druid](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Wizard](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Sorcerer](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md)
