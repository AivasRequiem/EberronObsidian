# Necrotic Tempest
*Eldritch Storm*  

Storms infused with the essence of death roil with dark clouds that manifest leering skulls and bone-white lightning. Any creature exposed to the storm that isn't a construct or an undead must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of each minute or take `3d6` necrotic damage.

A creature that dies in a necrotic tempest rises as a [skeleton](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/undead/skeleton-xmm.md) or [zombie](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie-xmm.md) (your choice) `d10` minutes later.

A necrotic tempest lasts for `d4` hours and leaves crops withered and wells undrinkable for `d4` days after its passing.
