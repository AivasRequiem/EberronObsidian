*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 335*  

Dire worgs are larger than common worgs and possess a supernaturally terrifying howl. They frequently hunt alongside ettins, ogres, and trolls.

## Worgs

*Malicious Lupine Ravagers*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Grassland, Hill, Planar (Feywild)  
- **Treasure.** None  

Sometimes mistaken at first for giant wolves, worgs are vicious hunters. These sapient predators can speak and often taunt their prey, enjoying the taste of fear in their meals.
