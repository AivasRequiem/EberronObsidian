## Roper

*Tentacled Subterranean Trapper*

- **Habitat.** Underdark  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Camouflaged as rock formations, ropers are aberrant ambushers that lurk in wait for smaller creatures. These bizarre subterranean hunters extend their rubbery tentacles to explore and prod their surroundings, often reaching beyond their fields of vision. Should they encounter prey, these limbs ensnare victims and drag them close to ropers' toothy maws. If these tentacles are severed, ropers rapidly grow replacements.

Ropers can move, albeit slowly. Crawling on the sticky cilia that cover their undersides, ropers can climb walls and suspend themselves from ceilings. These hunters often position themselves in unexpected or treacherous locations, using their surroundings to weaken their prey. Roll on or choose a result from the Roper Hazards table to inspire what dangers ropers employ when ambushing prey.
