Space clowns are the inhabitants of a Wildspace system known as Clownspace. The humans who once inhabited the system's three ring-shaped worlds placed their faith in a god of revelry. Their worship ceremonies were centered on festivals and frivolity. Over time, the people's happiness hinged on the ever-increasing consumption of an elixir called Thrill Joy. Only after they became addicted did they discover that the priests of their faith had distilled the elixir from demonic ichor and the nectar of the bozo flower. Eventually, Thrill Joy transformed the faithful into fiendish creatures and "blessed" them with clown-like appearances.

Space clowns acquired their first spelljamming helms from dohwar merchants (see " Dohwar "). Subsequent visits to other Wildspace systems led to contact with a multitude of other folk. In the wake of these encounters, love and fear of clowns has spread to all corners of the multiverse, just as the space clowns have done themselves.

Marauding space clowns feed on Humanoid flesh. They travel through space in garishly decorated ships and sometimes take up residence on populated worlds, where they set up carnival tents to lure curious onlookers into their clutches. They are armed with colorfully painted ray guns that work only for them; these toys are harmless in the hands of anyone else.
