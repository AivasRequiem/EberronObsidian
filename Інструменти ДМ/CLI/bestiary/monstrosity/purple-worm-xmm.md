## Purple Worm

*What Gnaws the Roots of the World*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Underdark  
- **Treasure.** None  

Titanic purple worms burrow through the earth and sand. Ever ravenous, they devour smaller creatures and ravage entire communities in their aimless burrowing.

> Purple worms alone are bad enough, but the blasted monsters have a knack for unearthing things that are even worse!
