## Mimic

*Shape-Shifter Disguised as an Unassuming Object*

- **Habitat.** Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** Any  

In their natural forms, mimics are little more than roaming stomachs, their blobby bodies covered with alien eyes and teeth. They can alter their color, texture, and dimensions to duplicate inanimate objects of their approximate size. Mimics use their disguises as both camouflage and bait. Once victims draw close, mimics strike, lashing out with their sticky pseudopods and toothy mouths. After consuming victims, mimics usually relocate, change form, and await their next meal.
