# [Undercity Medusa](Інструменти ДМ\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/undercity-medusa-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 222*  

The medusas of Ravnica, often called gorgons, are a monstrous race of creatures that appear superficially similar to human women. In place of hair, a gorgon has a writhing mass of black, serpentine cables, and its hands are scaly claws.

The gaze of a medusa's glowing eyes causes living tissue to petrify. The transformation is rapid, leaving the victim as a stone statue, usually frozen in a position of abject fear or agony-a fine trophy for the medusa's macabre collection. The medusa must exert its will to effect this transformation, so the gaze of a surprised or friendly Ravnican medusa is harmless.

This deadly gaze attack gives medusas a degree of power among the Golgari that is out of proportion with their small numbers. Medusas command a significant share of the guild's smaller cells around Ravnica, and at least one medusa is thought to be angling for control of the entire guild at the moment.

Not all gorgons are so ambitious; some prefer to simply stalk the endless shadows of the undercity like hungry predators.
