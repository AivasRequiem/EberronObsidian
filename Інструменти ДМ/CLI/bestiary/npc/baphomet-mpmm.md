# [Baphomet](Інструменти ДМ\CLI\bestiary\npc/baphomet-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 58*  

Civilization is weakness and brutality is strength in the credo of Baphomet, the Horned King and the Prince of Beasts. He is worshiped by those who want to break the confines of civility and unleash their bestial natures, for Baphomet envisions a world without restraint, where creatures live out their most bloodthirsty desires.

Cults devoted to Baphomet use mazes and complex knots as their emblems. They create secret places to indulge themselves, including labyrinths of the sort their master favors. Bloodstained crowns and weapons of iron and brass decorate their profane altars.

Over time, a mpmm becomes tainted by his influence, gaining bloodshot eyes and coarse, thickening hair. Small horns eventually sprout from the cultist's forehead. In time, a devoted cultist might transform entirely into a minotaur, which is considered the greatest gift of the Prince of Beasts.

Baphomet appears as a fearsome, 20-foot-tall minotaur with six iron horns. A fiendish light burns in his red eyes. Although he is filled with bestial blood lust, there lies within him a cruel and cunning intellect devoted to subverting all civilization.

Baphomet wields a great glaive called Heartcleaver. He also charges his enemies and gores them with his horns, trampling his foes into the earth and rending them with his teeth like a beast.

## Baphomet's Lair

Baphomet's lair is his palace, the Lyktion, which is on the layer of the Abyss called the Endless Maze. Nestled within the twisting passages of the planewide labyrinth, the Lyktion is immaculately maintained and surrounded by a moat constructed in the fashion of a three-dimensional maze. The palace is a towering structure whose interior is as labyrinthine as the plane on which it stands; it is populated by [minotaurs](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur-of-baphomet-xmm.md), [goristros](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/fiend/goristro-xmm.md), and [quasits](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/bestiary/fiend/quasit-xmm.md).
