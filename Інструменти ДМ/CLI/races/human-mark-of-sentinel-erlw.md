## Traits

### Age

Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

### Size

Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.

### Sentinel's Intuition

When you make a Wisdom ([Insight](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) or Wisdom ([Perception](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, you can roll a `d4` and add the number rolled to the ability check.

### Guardian's Shield

You can cast the [shield](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/spells/shield-xphb.md) spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it after you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

### Vigilant Guardian

When a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to swap places with that creature, and you are hit by the attack instead. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Spells of the Mark

If you have the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Sentinel Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class.
