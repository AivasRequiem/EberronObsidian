# Voyager Staff
*Staff, weapon, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  


- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [Versatile](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic quarterstaff. While you hold it, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls.

This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff's charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [banishment](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/spells/banishment-xphb.md) (4 charges), [blink](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/spells/blink-xphb.md) (3 charges), [misty step](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/spells/misty-step-xphb.md) (2 charges), [passwall](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/spells/passwall-xphb.md) (5 charges), or [teleport](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/spells/teleport-xphb.md) (7 charges).

The staff regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff vanishes forever.
