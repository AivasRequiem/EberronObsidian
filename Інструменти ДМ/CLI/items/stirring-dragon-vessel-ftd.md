# Stirring Dragon Vessel
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  



This vessel can be a potion bottle, drinking horn, or other container meant to hold a liquid.

As a bonus action, if the vessel is empty, you can speak the command word to fill the vessel with one of the following (your choice): ale, olive oil, mead, a [potion of healing](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/items/potion-of-healing-xdmg.md), a [potion of greater healing](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/items/potion-of-greater-healing-xdmg.md), a [potion of climbing](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/items/potion-of-climbing-xdmg.md), or a [potion of fire breath](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/items/potion-of-fire-breath-xdmg.md). Once this property is used, it can't be used until the next dawn. A potion you create in this way loses its magical properties if it isn't imbibed within 24 hours.
