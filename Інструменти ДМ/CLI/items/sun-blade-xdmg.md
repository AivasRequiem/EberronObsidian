# Sun Blade
*Weapon ([longsword](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/items/longsword-xphb.md)), rare (requires attunement)*  
![](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/items/img/sun-blade.webp#right)

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d8 radiant
  - Two-handed: 1d10 radiant
- **Properties**: [Finesse](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Versatile](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This item appears to be a sword hilt.

## Blade of Radiance

While grasping the hilt, you can take a [Bonus Action](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to cause a blade of pure radiance to spring into existence or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic weapon functions as a Longsword with [Finesse](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse). If you are proficient with Longswords or Shortswords, you are proficient with the Sun Blade.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals Radiant damage instead of Slashing damage. When you hit an Undead with it, that target takes an extra `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) Radiant damage.

## Sunlight

The sword's luminous blade emits [Bright Light](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) in a 15-foot radius and [Dim Light](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can take a [Magic](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to expand or reduce its radius of [Bright Light](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) and [Dim Light](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.
