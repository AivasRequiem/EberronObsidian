# Dust of Sneezing and Choking
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/items/img/dust-of-sneezing-and-choking.webp#right)


Found in a small container, this powder resembles [Dust of Disappearance](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/items/dust-of-disappearance-xdmg.md), and [Identify](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/spells/identify-xphb.md) reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

As a [Utilize](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/actions.md#Utilize) action, you can throw the dust into the air, forcing yourself and every creature in a 30-foot [Emanation](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) originating from you to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Constructs, Elementals, Oozes, Plants, and Undead succeed on the save automatically.

On a failed save, a creature begins sneezing uncontrollably; it has the [Incapacitated](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition and is suffocating. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect also ends on any creature targeted by a [Lesser Restoration](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration-xphb.md) spell.
