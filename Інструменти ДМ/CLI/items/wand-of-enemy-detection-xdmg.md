# Wand of Enemy Detection
*Wand, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/items/img/wand-of-enemy-detection.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can take a [Magic](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 charge. For 1 minute, you know the direction of the nearest creature [Hostile](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hostile-attitude-xphb.md) to you within 60 feet, but not its distance from you. The wand can sense the presence of [Hostile](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hostile-attitude-xphb.md) creatures that are [Invisible](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible), ethereal, disguised, or hidden, as well as those in plain sight. The effect ends if you stop holding the wand.

## Regaining Charges

The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll `d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
