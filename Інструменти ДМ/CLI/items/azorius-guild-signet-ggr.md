# Azorius Guild Signet
*Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/items/img/azorius-guild-signet.webp#right)


This ring, adorned with the symbol of Azorius, allows you to cast [ensnaring strike](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/spells/ensnaring-strike-xphb.md). A guild signet is sometimes awarded to a guild member whose renown score in that guild is 5 or higher, as a reward for performing special services for the guild. Aside from its magical properties, the ring is also an indicator of Azorius's recognition and favor.

A signet has 3 charges, and it regains `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can expend 1 charge to cast the associated spell (save DC 13).
