# Docent
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a warforged)*  



A docent is a small metal sphere, about 2 inches across, studded with dragonshards. To attune to a docent, you must embed the item somewhere on your body, such as your chest or your eye socket.

## Sentience

A docent is a sentient item of any alignment with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. It perceives the world through your senses. It communicates telepathically with you and can speak, read, and understand any language it knows (see "Random Properties" below).

## Life Support

Whenever you end your turn with 0 hit points, the docent can make a Wisdom ([Medicine](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check with a +6 bonus. If this check succeeds, the docent stabilizes you.

## Random Properties

A docent has the following properties:

**Languages**. The docent knows Common, Giant, and `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) additional languages chosen by the DM. If a docent knows fewer than six languages, it can learn a new language after it hears or reads the language through your senses.

**Skills**. The docent has a +7 bonus to one of the following skills (roll a `dice:d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`)): (1) [Arcana](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana), (2) [History](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/skills.md#History), (3) [Investigation](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation), or (4) [Nature](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature).

**Spells**. The docent knows one of the following spells and can cast it at will, requiring no components (roll a `dice:d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`)): (1–2) [detect evil and good](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good-xphb.md) or (3–6) [detect magic](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/spells/detect-magic-xphb.md). The docent decides when to cast the spell.

## Personality

A docent is designed to advise and assist the warforged it's attached to. One of the simple functions of a docent is to serve as a translator. The docent's properties are under its control, and if you have a bad relationship with your docent, it might refuse to assist you.
