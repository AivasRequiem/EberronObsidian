# Cape of the Mountebank
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/items/img/cape-of-the-mountebank.webp#right)


This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast [Dimension Door](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/spells/dimension-door-xphb.md) as a [Magic](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

When you teleport with that spell, you leave behind a cloud of smoke. The space you left is [Lightly Obscured](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/lightly-obscured-xphb.md) by that smoke until the end of your next turn.
