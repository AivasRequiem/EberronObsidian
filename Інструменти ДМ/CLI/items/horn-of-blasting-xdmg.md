# Horn of Blasting
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/items/img/horn-of-blasting.webp#right)


You can take a [Magic](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot [Cone](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb.md) that is audible out to 600 feet. Each creature in the [Cone](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb.md) makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `5d8` Thunder damage and has the [Deafened](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Deafened) condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. Glass or crystal objects in the [Cone](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb.md) that aren't being worn or carried take `10d8` Thunder damage.

Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals `10d6` Force damage to the user and destroys the horn.
