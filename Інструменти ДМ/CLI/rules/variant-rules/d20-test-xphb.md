# D20 Test
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 364. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

D20 Tests encompass the three main d20 rolls of the game: [ability checks](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/ability-check-xphb.md), [attack rolls](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/attack-roll-xphb.md), and [saving throws](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/saving-throw-xphb.md). If something in the game affects D20 Tests, it affects all three of these rolls. The DM determines whether a D20 Test is warranted in a given circumstance.
