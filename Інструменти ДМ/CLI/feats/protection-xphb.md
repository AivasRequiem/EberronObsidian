# Protection
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 209*  

**Prerequisite**: Fighting Style Feature

When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can take a [Reaction](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to interpose your [Shield](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/items/shield-xphb.md) if you're holding one. You impose [Disadvantage](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on the triggering attack roll and all other attack rolls against the target until the start of your next turn if you remain within 5 feet of the target.
