# Draconic Senses
*Draconic Gift, rare*  

You gain keen senses like a dragon's.

## Blindsight

You have [blindsight](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/senses.md#Blindsight) to a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're [blinded](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) or in darkness. Moreover, you can see [invisible](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creatures within that range, unless the creatures successfully hide from you.

## Keen Senses

You have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](Інструменти%20ДМ/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks.
